### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 20-year-old recent PhD graduate and medical AI researcher. During my Ph.D., I  worked in the Levenson Lab focusing on applying deep learning for image enhancement of slide-free microscopy imaging applied to pathology. 

I currently work as a Research Director at [Stability AI](https://stability.ai) and am the CEO of [MedARC](https://medarc.ai).
