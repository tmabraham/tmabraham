### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 21-year-old medical AI and generative AI researcher. I obtained my Ph.D. at 19 years old at UC Davis. I worked in the Levenson Lab focusing on applying deep learning for image enhancement of slide-free microscopy imaging applied to pathology. I previously worked as a Research Director at [Stability AI](https://stability.ai) and am the founder and former CEO of [MedARC](https://medarc.ai).
